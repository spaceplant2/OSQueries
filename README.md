# OSQueries
### ***Useful OSQueries.***  
Deveolped simultaneously for Sophos and Wazuh, my aim is to make sure all queries are cross-compatible.  
I've looked at a lot of stuff written for OSQuery, and it all feels like it was created by theroists without any practical testing. So I thought I'd add my own voice to the caucopohony.  

Happy Hunting!!!
